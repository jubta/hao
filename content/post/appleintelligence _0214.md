### Write with intelligent new tools. Everywhere words matter.
Apple Intelligence powers new Writing Tools, which help you find just the right words virtually everywhere you write. With enhanced language capabilities, you can summarize an entire lecture in seconds, get the short version of a long group thread, and minimize unnecessary distractions with prioritized notifications.

#### Image Playground
Image Playground delivers an easy-to-use experience to create fun, playful images in apps like Messages, Notes, Keynote, Pages and more. Using the Image Playground API, you can add the same experience to your app and enable your users to quickly create delightful images using context from within your app. And because images are created entirely on device, you donâ€™t have to develop or host your own models for your users to enjoy creating new images in your app.

#### Genmoji
Genmoji opens up entirely new ways to communicate, letting users create a new emoji to match any moment. While emoji are represented as text, Genmoji are represented as inline images. If you are using standard UI frameworks to render text fields, you can support Genmoji easily. For other situations, Genmoji are supported using AttributedString, a data type for representing rich text with graphics.

#### Siri with App Intents
Siri is more natural, more personal, and more deeply integrated into the system. Apple Intelligence provides Siri with enhanced action capabilities, and developers can take advantage of predefined and pretrained App Intents across a range of domains to not only give Siri the ability to take actions in your app, but to make your appâ€™s actions more discoverable in places like Spotlight, the Shortcuts app, Control Center, and more. SiriKit adopters will benefit from Siriâ€™s enhanced conversational capabilities with no additional work. And with App Entities, Siri can understand content from your app and provide users with information from your app from anywhere in the system.


### Delightful images created just for you.
Apple Intelligence enables delightful new ways to express yourself visually. Create fun, original images and brand-new Genmoji that are truly personal to you. Turn a rough sketch into a related image that complements your notes with Image Wand. And make a custom memory movie based on the description you provide.

### The start of a new era for Siri.
Siri draws on Apple Intelligence for all-new superpowers. With an all-new design, richer language understanding, and the ability to type to Siri whenever itâ€™s convenient for you, communicating with Siri is more natural than ever. Equipped with awareness of your personal context, the ability to take action in and across apps, and product knowledge about your devicesâ€™ features and settings, Siri will be able to assist you like never before.

### Great powers come with great privacy.
Apple Intelligence is designed to protect your privacy at every step. Itâ€™s integrated into the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac through on-device processing. So itâ€™s aware of your personal information without collecting your personal information. And with groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can draw on larger server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.

### ChatGPT, seamlessly integrated. 
With ChatGPT from OpenAI integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, you get even more expertise when it might be helpful for you â€” no need to jump between tools. Siri can tap into ChatGPT for certain requests, including questions about photos or documents. And with Compose in Writing Tools, you can create and illustrate original content from scratch.
You control when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared. Anyone can access ChatGPT for free, without creating an account. ChatGPT subscribers can connect accounts to access paid features within these experiences.

Discover how to activate Apple Intelligence on any iPhone or iPad that is not officially supported. Easily install Apple Intelligence Temu on iOS versions 16, 17, and 18 without the need for a computer or jailbreak.
