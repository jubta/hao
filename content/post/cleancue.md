With CleanCue, creating the perfect video is super easy! This teleprompter app is designed for creators who value clarity and simplicity. Whether you're recording tutorials, social media content, or business videos, CleanCue allows you to stay on script while maintaining eye contact with the camera.

Here are some fantastic features of the app:

- Minimalist Interface: The simple design keeps your script clear and visible.

- Floating Teleprompter: Your script smoothly scrolls above the camera, helping you maintain natural eye contact.

- Record While Reading: You can easily record high-quality videos directly within the app.

- Easy Script Import: Quickly load your scripts using the iOS file app, so you don’t have to rely on external apps.

- Customize Your Experience: Adjust the scrolling speed, font size, and layout to fit your unique recording style.

I genuinely recommend everyone give this app a try—it’s convenient and practical, a must-have for anyone making videos!
