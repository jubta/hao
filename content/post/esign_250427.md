Iâ€™ve noticed that not many people know about this trick. If your phone ends up on a blacklist or gets revoked, thereâ€™s a way to clear it without losing any dataâ€”as long as your device is running iOS versions between 15 and 18.2 beta2. Iâ€™ve tried it out, and honestly, itâ€™s pretty slick.

What I like about it:

- No data loss at allâ€”your info stays safe.
- Itâ€™s really fast and you just need to run a few lines of code.
- The process is straightforward if you follow the video guide step by step.

Downsides to keep in mind:

- It only works on some devices (iOS 15 up to iOS 18.2 beta2).
- Youâ€™ll need a computer to make it happen.
- A little bit of coding knowledge is necessary, so it might be a bit daunting if youâ€™re not comfortable with that.

Overall, if your device qualifies, this method is a super convenient and quick fix. Just be sure to double-check that your iOS version is within range before giving it a goâ€”and follow the instructions carefully to avoid any hiccups.
