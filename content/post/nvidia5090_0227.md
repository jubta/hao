## **5090 Graphics Card: Luxurious Specs, Absurd Price—Dare You Buy It?**

The specs of this graphics card are truly jaw-dropping: a single 5090 GPU comes bundled with 20 i9 processors! It’s been a while since I last paid attention to desktop PCs. Originally, I planned to check out the price when the 5090 launched, maybe do an unboxing experience, but not only is it sold out, now I have to deal with the bundled accessories issue—and this time, the bundled config is just absurd. Take ASUS’s 5090 release, for example: it’s not only equipped with the latest Intel i9-13900 processor, but it also comes standard with 20 i9s right out of the gate. At first glance, I thought it meant 20 separate boxes, but the real setup is actually 20 individual processors—and these i9s have all been downclocked. A single i9 costs as much as 400,000 [currency unspecified], which is simply mind-boggling!

So, what exactly is driving the sky-high price of the 5090? Beyond its exceptional performance, the key factor is NVIDIA’s extremely limited initial production run, causing a frenzy of buyers scrambling to get their hands on it. Drawing from my mining experience years ago, prices in Taiwan often get inflated to ridiculous levels, largely because there are always some wealthy buyers in the Chinese market snapping them up at premium rates. This time, with no standard 90-series models available in China, some people are buying the 5080 and 5090 at exorbitant prices and flipping them to Chinese buyers for even more. All in all, I’d suggest everyone hold off for now—the current prices are just too outrageous. With the 5080 and 5090 priced at 400,000, you’d be better off spending that money on a Hermès bag than this setup!
