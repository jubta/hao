## **iPhone 16E Review: Is It Worth Buying for Gaming and Battery Life at Rs. 21,090?**

After you guys finished testing and unboxing the iPhone 16E in the first place, let's explore whether the phone is worth buying, especially when it comes to S8 performance considerations.The removal of a GPU has resulted in the inability to turn on full effects when playing demanding games such as 'Toy Story' at around 40 fps, which is about 25% worse in terms of graphical performance compared to the full-blooded iPhone 16 Pro.In terms of display, its screen brightness is about 1300 nits, which may cause blurred vision in strong outdoor sunlight, but its color calibration performance is still excellent.As for battery life, thanks to the enlarged battery and the new C One communication chip, whether watching videos or playing games, the performance is excellent, and the battery life score is close to that of the iPhone 16 Pro. This time, the new C One chip is similar to that of the iPhone 4 in terms of 5G signal performance for the most part, with occasional slightly weaker signals, but the impact is not significant.Personally, I think the biggest highlight is its white color scheme, the lens design on the back of the body is very compact and stylish, and the light weight and high endurance is especially suitable for corporate users.Priced at Rs. 21,090, the price/performance ratio is mediocre, and I would recommend the iPhone 16, which has already had its price reduced in the channel, or the iPhone 15 Pro, which is in stock. for those who want to buy the iPhone 16E, I would recommend waiting for a month or two for channel specials or credit card campaigns, and it would be more cost-effective to get your hands on the device when the price is lower than Rs. 20,000.

各位在第一时间完成了对iPhone 16E的实测和开箱，接下来我们来探讨一下这款手机是否值得购买，特别是在S8性能方面考虑。由于移除了一个GPU，导致在进行如「豐鐵」这类要求较高的游戏时，无法开启全特效，帧数约在40帧，与满血的iPhone 16 Pro相比，图形性能大约差了25%。在显示方面，其屏幕亮度大约为1300尼特，在户外阳光强烈的情况下可能会有视线不清的情况，但其色准表现依然非常出色。至于续航，由于加大了电池，并搭载了新的C One通信芯片，无论是观看视频还是打游戏，表现都非常出色，续航成绩接近iPhone 16 Pro。这次新的C One芯片在5G信号表现上，大部分情况下与iPhone 4相似，偶尔会出现信号稍弱的情况，但影响不大。个人认为，最大的亮点在于其白色配色，机身背面的镜头设计非常紧凑时尚，轻量化和高续航特别适合企业用户。定价为21,090元，性价比一般，我更推荐已在渠道中降价的iPhone 16或有库存的iPhone 15 Pro。想购买iPhone 16E的人，我建议等待一两个月的渠道优惠活动或信用卡活动，在价格低于20,000元时再入手更为划算。
