YouTube has recently launched a new plan called "Premium Lite," priced at$7.99 per month(approximately NT$262). This plan allows users to enjoy ad-free viewing for select videos. It was initially available for trial in Thailand, Germany, and Australia, and has recently been introduced to the U.S. market

YouTube Premium product management director Jack Greenberg recently announced the expansion of the "Premium Lite" trial to the United States. This new and more affordable option allows users to pay just $7.99 per month to enjoy ad-free viewing for most videos. In the coming weeks, "Premium Lite" will be made available to all users in the current pilot countries, including Thailand, Germany, and Australia.

Greenberg noted that the number of global users for "YouTube Music" and "Premium" has reached 150 million. Additionally, the official statement mentioned that when using "Premium Lite," users can enjoy ad-free viewing for content in categories like gaming, fashion, aesthetics, news, comedy, cooking, and learning. However, ads will still play for music and music video content. Furthermore, features such as video downloads and background playback are not supported in this plan to distinguish it from the standard "Premium" offering.

Currently, the "Premium Lite" plan is not available for trial in many regions. However, the official statement indicated that there are plans to gradually expand the pilot to other countries this year. Therefore, it may not be long before it becomes available to us.

It is worth noting that the cost of "YouTube Premium" varies from country to country. For instance, in the United States, the Premium subscription costs $13.99 per month, while in other countries, it is only NT$199. Therefore, when "Premium Lite" is launched in other regions, the actual price is likely to be lower than that in the U.S.
