Installing IPA files on your iPhone or iPad necessitates importing a valid signing certificate to ensure the Esign app functions correctly. These certificates can be purchased from independent retailers offering P12 certificates for individual or corporate use. Personal certificates begin at $10 annually and are installable on a single device.

### Requirements:

* Latest Esign app version on your iPhone or iPad.
* Ready P12 Certificate and MobileProvision files.
* Internet connection for signing apps.
* Example P12 Certificate (Password: AppleP12.com).

### Purchasing a P12 Certificate:

To acquire a signing certificate for Esign, you need to locate a provider that can generate a P12 Certificate for your iPhone or iPad for import into the Esign app. Annual rates vary from $7 to about $26, reflecting different revoke protection durations. Unlike using Bullfrog Assistant and a free Apple ID-associated certificate for app signing, a purchased P12 Certificate allows sideloading unlimited apps. Popular providers include:

* #### **[  apptesters](https://apptesters.org/purchase-certificate/)**

* #### **[  GBox](https://gbox.run/tool/udid)**

Even with a purchased P12 Certificate for the Esign app, revocation by Apple is possible. Retailers typically offer a few certificates for the price of one if the main certificate is revoked, although you may need to buy a new valid signing certificate for iOS again. The longevity of the certificate to sign IPA files is not guaranteed.

If your P12 certificate is revoked while under warranty, the store will replace it without charge. Note that obtaining a new certificate typically takes 3–7 days. Alternatively, you can generate a P12 Certificate through an active Apple Developer Program.

### Downloading Free P12 Certificates:

The community often offers P12 Certificates for free download, but Apple is increasingly aware of and monitoring these signing certificates.

### Where to download free P12 Certificates
P12 Certificates are frequently made available for free download by the community. But Apple is taking notice of such signing certificates since they are attracting a lot of consumers. Typically, a free P12 certificate can be obtained in a matter of hours or days. There is no guarantee when on where a free P12 certificate for the Esign app will be published.
If the certificate cannot be verified, then the certificate is no longer valid for you and it probably was revoked by Apple.  **[ Follow this Telegram channel for free P12 Certificates](https://t.me/AppleP12)** updates.
