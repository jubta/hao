### **Introduction**

Tesla's unmanned taxis are now officially on the road, directly after the Waymo experience in the United States, Tesla's unmanned taxis are now officially on the road. A U.S. netizen photographed a Model Y with the word "Robotaxi" written on it as it drove itself around a corner, and this video was forwarded to Tesla by its executives, who confirmed that this was the legendary Tesla unmanned taxicab, which is a more sophisticated car compared to the other self-driven taxis, which rely on a photodiode.Tesla chose a purely visual solution based on cameras and ultrasonic sensors to take care of everything. Although it is claimed to be an unsupervised model, there will be a remote team to monitor the vehicle's operation in real time. At present, the Tesla Trolley will initially be limited to Austin, Texas, to do a trial operation, so friends who need it can go to Austin to try it out.
