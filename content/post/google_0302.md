## **Google Cloud Drive Now Automatically Transcribes and Subtitles Videos**

Google is launching a transcription service and a new subtitle feature for videos on cloud drives, and while subtitles have been available for a while now, the transcription feature is a very useful and important upgrade that helps you quickly find the right part of the movie you're looking for when you're watching it on a cloud drive, thanks to expanded use of AI, of course.

## Google Cloud Drive Now Automatically Transcribes and Subtitles Videos

As early as 2024, Google started adding YouTube-like automatic subtitles for videos uploaded to the cloud.For videos that have already been processed, there is an additional subtitle button in the player interface.Subtitles are automatically grabbed from the movie's audio track, but the process doesn't always happen automatically after a movie is uploaded - by default, it's enabled for Google Workspace accounts if the administrator gives permission, but personal Google accounts require you to request automatic subtitles first.

Now, Google is expanding automatic subtitling with a new transcription viewer that can be opened from the movie player with the click of a button.A new menu option for the single-click transcription feature opens in the sidebar, which contains the chronological order of the words spoken in the movie, a timeline, and a search field for finding specific statements.

In its official blog, Google mentioned that last year it launched the ability for users to automatically generate subtitles for any video uploaded to Google Cloud Drive, improving accessibility and saving users the effort of manually adding subtitles.The video transcription feature is designed to capitalize on this functionality and make discovering, referencing and improving video content more efficient.It works much like YouTube's transcription but is much better (YouTube doesn't have a search function) and is especially helpful in long videos.If you're not sure where in the movie a clip is, but don't want to take your time watching the entire movie, the transcript can be a great way to direct you to the specific clip.

Starting February 24, 2025, it will take up to 15 days for the new feature to reach users worldwide, so if you haven't seen it in a movie yet, you can start by checking to see if the subtitles are already there - again, personal accounts won't be automatically triggered to auto-generate them, they'll have to be requested manually.If you find that the video has subtitles, but you haven't seen the transcript yet, it means that the update is not yet available to you, so please be patient.
