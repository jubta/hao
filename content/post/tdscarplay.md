## **UPDATED!**

更新 TDS Carpay 應用程式來在車上觀看 YouTube 影片。
這個應用程式已經推出了新版本，使用起來更簡單了。之前你就可以免費觀看 YouTube，現在依然可以，只是操作會稍微複雜一點。不過在 iPhone 的 iOS 17 或 18 上仍然是可行的。

這次更新主要新增了「螢幕鏡像（Screen Mirror）」功能，讓你可以把手機畫面投影到車載螢幕上，而且不需要解鎖螢幕即可操作。

安裝 Testflight App 和 TDS Carpay App 的方法不困難。觀看文章下方，可以點擊連結。就可以找到 Testflight App 和 TDS Carpay App 的下載連結。請分別安裝這兩個 App。

安裝完成後，請先開啟 TDS App 並進行更新，確保你使用的是最新版本。這個版本已經修復了螢幕鏡像的相關問題。

接下來滑下手機畫面、向右滑開「控制中心」，然後進入設定，把「螢幕錄製」加入控制中心。如果已經加入了，只需要長按螢幕錄製按鈕，然後選擇「TDS」，按下開始錄製即可。

這時候打開 TDS Carpay App，選擇「Screen Mirror」功能。要使用這個功能，必須先用傳輸線將 iPhone 連接到車機上。連接好之後就可以開始投影畫面了。

需要注意的是，這款 App 目前還是測試版，所以畫面可能會無法自動旋轉成橫向顯示。如果遇到這種情況，請到設定中手動把螢幕鎖定關閉，然後把手機橫放就可以了。雖然目前使用上稍微有點麻煩，但它仍然能讓你免費將 YouTube 投影到車上觀看。還是蠻不錯！

如果你覺得這個 App 不錯，也可以贊助作者一杯咖啡來支持開發。

Update the TDS Carpay app to watch YouTube videos in your car.
The app has been updated to a new version and is now easier to use. Previously, you could watch YouTube for free, and you still can—it’s just a bit more complicated. However, it still works on iPhones running iOS 17 or 18.

This update introduces the new Screen Mirror feature, which allows you to mirror your phone’s screen to your car’s display, without needing to unlock your phone.

Installing the TestFlight app and the TDS Carpay app is simple. Scroll down the article and click the link to find the download links for both TestFlight and TDS Carpay. Install both apps separately.

Once installed, open the TDS app and update it to make sure you’re using the latest version. This version includes fixes for the screen mirroring feature.

Next, swipe down your phone screen and slide right to open the Control Center. Go to Settings and add Screen Recording to the Control Center. If it’s already added, simply long-press the Screen Recording button, select TDS, and tap Start Recording.

Now, open the TDS Carpay app and select the Screen Mirror option. To use this feature, you must connect your iPhone to your car using a cable. Once connected, your screen can be mirrored to the car display.

Please note that this app is still in beta, so the screen may not automatically rotate to landscape mode. If that happens, go to your phone’s settings, turn off the screen rotation lock, and rotate your phone manually to view in landscape. Although the process may be slightly tricky, it still allows you to watch YouTube on your car screen for free — which is pretty nice!

If you find the app useful, consider supporting the developer by buying them a coffee.

I’ve noticed that not many people know about this trick. If your phone ends up on a blacklist or gets revoked, there’s a way to clear it without losing any data—as long as your device is running iOS versions between 15 and 18.2 beta2. I’ve tried it out, and honestly, it’s pretty slick.

What I like about it:

- No data loss at all—your info stays safe.
- It’s really fast and you just need to run a few lines of code.
- The process is straightforward if you follow the video guide step by step.

Downsides to keep in mind:

- It only works on some devices (iOS 15 up to iOS 18.2 beta2).
- You’ll need a computer to make it happen.
- A little bit of coding knowledge is necessary, so it might be a bit daunting if you’re not comfortable with that.

Overall, if your device qualifies, this method is a super convenient and quick fix. Just be sure to double-check that your iOS version is within range before giving it a go—and follow the instructions carefully to avoid any hiccups.
